A typed GraphQL client library for Rust.

## Features

- Precise types for query variables and responses
- Supports GraphQL fragments, objects, unions, inputs, enums, custom scalars and input objects
- Works in the browser (WebAssembly)

## Getting started

- If you are not familiar with GraphQL, the [official website](https://graphql.org/) provides a very good and comprehensive introduction.

- Once you have written your query (most likely in something like [graphiql](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql)), save it in a `.graphql` file in your project.

- In order to provide precise types for a response, graphql_client needs to read the query and the schema at compile-time.

  To download the schema, you have multiple options. This projects provides a [CLI](https://github.com/tomhoule/graphql-client/tree/master/graphql_client_cli), but there are also more mature tools like [apollo-cli](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-cli). It does not matter which one you use, the resulting `schema.json` is the same.

- We now have everything we need to derive Rust types for our query. This is achieved through a procedural macro, as in the following snippet:

  ```rust
  extern crate serde;
  #[macro_use]
  extern crate serde_derive;
  #[macro_use]
  extern crate graphql_client;

  // The paths are relative to the directory where your `Cargo.toml` is located.
  // Both json and the GraphQL schema language are supported as sources for the schema
  #[derive(GraphQLQuery)]
  #[graphql(
      schema_path = "src/graphql/schema.json",
      query_path = "src/graphql/queries/my_query.graphql",
  )]
  pub struct MyQuery;
  ```

  The `derive` will generate a module named `my_query` in this example - the name is the struct's name, but in snake case.

  That module contains all the struct and enum definitions necessary to deserialize a response to that query.

  The root type for the response is named `ResponseData`. The GraphQL response will take the form of a `GraphQLResponse<ResponseData>` (the [GraphQLResponse](https://docs.rs/graphql_client/latest/graphql_client/struct.GraphQLResponse.html) type is always the same).

  The module also contains a struct called `Variables` representing the variables expected by the query.

* We now need to create the complete payload that we are going to send to the server. For convenience, the [GraphQLQuery trait](https://docs.rs/graphql_client/latest/graphql_client/trait.GraphQLQuery.html), is implemented for the struct under derive, so a complete query body can be created this way:

  ```rust
  extern crate failure;
  #[macro_use]
  extern crate graphql_client;
  extern crate reqwest;

  fn perform_my_query(variables: &my_query::Variables) -> Result<(), failure::Error> {

      // this is the important line
      let request_body = MyQuery::expand(variables);

      let client = reqwest::Client::new();
      let mut res = client.post("/graphql").json(&request_body).send()?;
      let response_body: GraphQLResponse<my_query::ResponseData> = res.json()?;
      println!("{:#?}", response_body);
      Ok(())
  }
  ```

[A complete example using the GitHub GraphQL API is available](https://github.com/tomhoule/graphql-client/tree/master/examples/github), as well as sample [rustdoc output](https://www.tomhoule.com/docs/example_module/).

## Examples

See the examples directory in this repository.

## Roadmap

A lot of desired features have been defined in issues.

graphql_client does not provide any networking, caching or other client functionality yet. Integration with different HTTP libraries is planned, although building one yourself is trivial (just send the constructed request payload as JSON with a POST request to a GraphQL endpoint, modulo authentication).

There is an embryonic CLI for downloading schemas - the plan is to make it something similar to `apollo-codegen`.
